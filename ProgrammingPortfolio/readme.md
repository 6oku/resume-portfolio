# CrayonTip Project
The CrayonTip project is a web application built in Django that allows users to critique graphical designs based on various design elements such as color, contrast, typography, etc. This is done in a 50 question quiz. It features an account registry, log-in, and system code generation for users to send/receive quizzes for a specific design. This project allowed me to get a comprehensive understanding of front-end programming for a large web application in a developer-to-client business environment.

# Jazz 21-22 Season Database 
This database was built-in SQL and a java application communicating with the database to report and record the NBA 2021-2022 Utah Jazz seasonal records. Building databases and understanding the structure of databases helped me understand concepts and processes for information technology. Having that database communicate with a java application allowed me to bridge any gaps of understanding with what's really happening with a lot of software. 

This application allows you to:

- report recorded Jazz game's summaries

- report Jazz players who scored the most per game

- record information for Jazz games already played

- record Jazz players who scored the most per game

# NumberNinjaWebGLBuild
Number Ninja is a educational math game for children ages 6-8 years of age. It allows students and users to test their math skills in a timely manner in a enganging 2D platformer. This project was an important milestone for me. This project gave me experience in what it was like to work on a large project with multiple developers. I learned a lot about what it was like to organize, develop, and roll out a software development project to a client in a business enviorment. 

The math skills covered in this game are:

- simple addition

- simple subtraction

- recognizing places (ones to hundreds)
