Number Ninja is a educational math game for children. It allows students and users to test their math skills in a timely manner in a enganging 2D platformer.

The math skills covered in this game are

- simple addition

- simple subtraction

- recognizing places (ones to hundreds)

This project was an important milestone for me. This project gave me experience in what it was like to work on a large project with multiple developers. I learned a lot about what it was like to develop and roll out a software development project to a client.
