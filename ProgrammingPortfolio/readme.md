# Jazz 21-22 Season Database 
This a database built in SQL and a java application communicating with the database to report and record the NBA 2021-2022 Utah Jazz seasonal records. Building databases and understanding the structure of databases helepd me understand a lot of concepts and processes for information technology. Having that database communicate with a java application allowed me to bridge any gaps of understanding with whats really happening with a lot of software.

# NumberNinjaWebGLBuild
Number Ninja is a educational math game for children ages 6-8 years of age. It allows students and users to test their math skills in a timely manner in a enganging 2D platformer. This project was an important milestone for me. This project gave me experience in what it was like to work on a large project with multiple developers. I learned a lot about what it was like to organize, develop, and roll out a software development project to a client. 

The math skills covered in this game are:

- simple addition

- simple subtraction

- recognizing places (ones to hundreds)
