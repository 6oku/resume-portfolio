# WayToWork
> WayToWork is a web application built as a solo project for productivity and mental health purposes. It features a minute timer, a notepad, and a to-do list in a single all in one style dashboard developed with the goal in mind to help users efficiently organize their work and projects. This project was a great experience for myself as I was doing fullstack development and gaining experience in project management. Creativity had an enourmous play with this as I was working through bugs and conceptually archeticting and designing the web app. This application was built using a variety of different languages, including javascript, python, css, and html. Here below is access to the reposity if you prefer that over the zip file of the project.

# CrayonTip Project
 > The CrayonTip project is a web application built in Django that allows users to critique graphical designs based on various design elements such as color, contrast, typography, etc. This is done in a 50 question quiz. It features an account registry, log-in, and system code generation for users to send/receive quizzes for a specific design. This project allowed me to get a comprehensive understanding of front-end programming for a large web application in a developer-to-client business environment. As a group project, this taught me a lot about collaborative and communative efforts not only with my team but with client we were working with.

# Jazz 21-22 Season Database 
> This database was built-in SQL and a java application communicating with the database to report and record the NBA 2021-2022 Utah Jazz seasonal records. Building databases and understanding the structure of databases helped me understand concepts and processes for information technology. Learning how to make a database taught me the importance of global responsibility when handling data in the modern world. Having that database communicate with a java application allowed me to bridge any gaps of understanding with what's really happening with a lot of software. 


This application allows you to:

- report recorded Jazz game's summaries

- report Jazz players who scored the most per game

- record information for Jazz games already played

- record Jazz players who scored the most per game
